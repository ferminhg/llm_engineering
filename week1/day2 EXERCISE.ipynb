    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."

      "Breaking Through the Performance Plateau\n",
      "The new era of intelligent advertising is here\n",
      "By\n",
      "Eric Danetz, President, Cognitiv\n",
      "2025 is shaping up to be the year of “performance,” but as technology advances, so does advertisers’ understanding of what that word really means. What used to be a simple equation of clicks and conversions has evolved into a much more reﬁned approach that aligns speciﬁc KPIs unique to each advertiser.\n",
      "With 42% of advertisers planning to increase their spend on performance advertising this year, according to WFA and Ebiquity’s\n",
      "“2025 Media Budgets Survey,”\n",
      "the focus is shifting to what truly drives success for each brand.\n",
      "A brand advertiser might deﬁne performance as an increase in awareness or purchase intent while a retailer focuses on sales or foot traﬃc. Generic proxy metrics no longer cut it. To truly measure performance, advertisers are embracing more sophisticated approaches—media mix modeling, multitouch attribution, and incremental lift that tells them something useful.\n",
      "Why advertisers are hitting the wall\n",
      "The push for advanced performance measurement comes down to one thing: Many advertisers are hitting a plateau. And when growth stalls, the ﬁrst step to correct it is understanding why. There are several industry trends causing this stagnation:\n",
      "Undifferentiated audience data:\n",
      "Everyone’s drinking from the same data well. When you rely on the same third-party data sources as your competitors, your ability to reach new, untapped audiences becomes severely limited.\n",
      "Overly restrictive brand safety\n",
      ": Those blunt keyword blocklists are killing your reach. They eliminate too much quality content, reducing scale or pushing spend to lower-quality placements.\n",
      "Ineffective contextual targeting:\n",
      "Broad, keyword-based strategies are too imprecise to deliver the targeting you actually need.\n",
      "At the same time, measurement capabilities have dramatically improved. The digitization of advertising is a game-changer. Take CTV, for example—it’s giving advertisers signiﬁcantly more measurability than linear TV ever could. Now, advertisers have a degree of clarity into campaign performance that wasn’t possible before. If they’re hitting the same audience over and over or running into scale limitations, an advertiser can now pinpoint the problem—and demand better solutions. No more guesswork.\n",
      "Drive real incremental lift\n",
      "The reality is simple: If you want better results, you’ve got to step outside what’s been working—or not working—and test new approaches and technologies. The key is knowing what to test and quantifying the risk versus reward.\n",
      "For example, when Welch’s needed to boost its sparkling grape juice sales, the brand didn’t just throw money at the same old targeting. Welch’s combined Cognitiv’s deep learning algorithms with in-store purchase data from Circana to identify genuinely new audiences. Cognitiv’s technology analyzed behavioral patterns of existing consumers, pinpointing audiences with similar preferences and higher purchase intent. As a result, Welch’s achieved a 47% higher engagement rate for relevant buyer groups vs. the client benchmarks.\n",
      "Find technology that delivers\n",
      "The adtech landscape is ﬂooded with vendors making extravagant claims about their AI capabilities. To ﬁnd solutions that drive lift, you need to ask hard questions about what’s genuinely different in their approach.\n",
      "You can achieve real incremental gains with an AI solution that frees up impressions previously blocked by outdated, overly cautious brand safety technology. Cognitiv demonstrated this with a major entertainment company using the ContextGPT tool to reach audiences for the company’s campaign. Unlike basic keyword-based targeting, the technology dynamically analyzed the real-time content that users were actively engaging with, delivering precisely targeted ads based on actual content engagement patterns. As a result, the campaign outperformed other partners with a 26X lower cost per unique reach, dramatically improving efficiency and performance.\n",
      "The power of ongoing optimization\n",
      "The signiﬁcant improvement in measurement capabilities is a genuine step forward for the industry. Advertising becomes vastly more effective when advertisers can clearly see what’s working and adjust their media plans accordingly.\n",
      "This requires not just measuring overall campaign performance, but implementing proper testing frameworks with controls and incremental lift analysis. When working with a leading cruise line to enhance its CTV strategy, Cognitiv went beyond automatic content recognition and content targeting to analyze the full user journey. By leveraging deep learning and sequential messaging across CTV and display, Cognitiv identiﬁed high-value prospects and optimized ad exposure sequencing—outperforming the client’s blended CPA benchmark by 45%.\n",
      "Solutions using genuine deep learning can incorporate inputs in real time and optimize mid-campaign, reducing waste and creating positive optimization cycles. Advertisers who embrace these feedback loops will break free from performance plateaus faster and achieve substantially better results than those clinging to outdated approaches.\n",

      "Eric Danetz, President, Cognitiv\n",
      "2025 is shaping up to be the year of “performance,” but as technology advances, so does advertisers’ understanding of what that word really means. What used to be a simple equation of clicks and conversions has evolved into a much more reﬁned approach that aligns speciﬁc KPIs unique to each advertiser.\n",
      "With 42% of advertisers planning to increase their spend on performance advertising this year, according to WFA and Ebiquity’s\n",
      "“2025 Media Budgets Survey,”\n",
      "the focus is shifting to what truly drives success for each brand.\n",
      "A brand advertiser might deﬁne performance as an increase in awareness or purchase intent while a retailer focuses on sales or foot traﬃc. Generic proxy metrics no longer cut it. To truly measure performance, advertisers are embracing more sophisticated approaches—media mix modeling, multitouch attribution, and incremental lift that tells them something useful.\n",
      "Why advertisers are hitting the wall\n",
      "The push for advanced performance measurement comes down to one thing: Many advertisers are hitting a plateau. And when growth stalls, the ﬁrst step to correct it is understanding why. There are several industry trends causing this stagnation:\n",
      "Undifferentiated audience data:\n",
      "Everyone’s drinking from the same data well. When you rely on the same third-party data sources as your competitors, your ability to reach new, untapped audiences becomes severely limited.\n",
      "Overly restrictive brand safety\n",
      ": Those blunt keyword blocklists are killing your reach. They eliminate too much quality content, reducing scale or pushing spend to lower-quality placements.\n",
      "Ineffective contextual targeting:\n",
      "Broad, keyword-based strategies are too imprecise to deliver the targeting you actually need.\n",
      "At the same time, measurement capabilities have dramatically improved. The digitization of advertising is a game-changer. Take CTV, for example—it’s giving advertisers signiﬁcantly more measurability than linear TV ever could. Now, advertisers have a degree of clarity into campaign performance that wasn’t possible before. If they’re hitting the same audience over and over or running into scale limitations, an advertiser can now pinpoint the problem—and demand better solutions. No more guesswork.\n",
      "Drive real incremental lift\n",
      "The reality is simple: If you want better results, you’ve got to step outside what’s been working—or not working—and test new approaches and technologies. The key is knowing what to test and quantifying the risk versus reward.\n",
      "For example, when Welch’s needed to boost its sparkling grape juice sales, the brand didn’t just throw money at the same old targeting. Welch’s combined Cognitiv’s deep learning algorithms with in-store purchase data from Circana to identify genuinely new audiences. Cognitiv’s technology analyzed behavioral patterns of existing consumers, pinpointing audiences with similar preferences and higher purchase intent. As a result, Welch’s achieved a 47% higher engagement rate for relevant buyer groups vs. the client benchmarks.\n",
      "Find technology that delivers\n",
      "The adtech landscape is ﬂooded with vendors making extravagant claims about their AI capabilities. To ﬁnd solutions that drive lift, you need to ask hard questions about what’s genuinely different in their approach.\n",
      "You can achieve real incremental gains with an AI solution that frees up impressions previously blocked by outdated, overly cautious brand safety technology. Cognitiv demonstrated this with a major entertainment company using the ContextGPT tool to reach audiences for the company’s campaign. Unlike basic keyword-based targeting, the technology dynamically analyzed the real-time content that users were actively engaging with, delivering precisely targeted ads based on actual content engagement patterns. As a result, the campaign outperformed other partners with a 26X lower cost per unique reach, dramatically improving efficiency and performance.\n",
